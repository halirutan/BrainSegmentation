# Charm Segmentation First Run

In this document is described a detailed overview of the CHARM (SimNIBS) segmentation installation, setting up and running.

## Description of the CHARM Method

The main goal of SimNIBS is to calculate electric fields caused by Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (TES) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS).

### Pipeline Steps

The pipeline is divided in three parts:

1. Automatic segmentation of MRI images and meshing to create individualized head models
2. Calculation of electric fields through the Finite Element Method (FEM)
3. Post-processing of results for further analysis.
